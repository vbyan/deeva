### Data structure

Your dataset **folder** should look like this:

```plaintext
data-path/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/        # Folder containing image files (e.g., .jpg, .png)
â”œâ”€â”€ labels/        # Folder containing label files (e.g., .txt, .xml)
â””â”€â”€ labelmap.txt   # A file mapping class IDs to class labels (optional)
```
<br>

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Analytics

Deeva offers a powerful set of **statistical insights** to give you a detailed understanding of your dataset, including:

### 1. **File Matching and Integrity**

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbyan/deeva/main/assets/data_match.gif">

- **Image-Label Matching**: Calculates how many images have **corresponding labels** (and vice versa).
- **Filename Consistency**: Identifies **misaligned or corrupted files** in images and labels.
- **Data Cleaning**: Provides tools to **identify and isolate** mismatched or corrupted files.


### 2. **Dataset Overview**

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbyan/deeva/main/assets/overall.gif">

- **File Formats & Backgrounds**: View format distribution (`yolo` vs. `voc`, `jpeg` vs. `png`).
- **Class Distribution**: Displays instance counts and images per class, highlighting any **class imbalances**.
- **Class Co-occurrence**: Shows how frequently different classes **appear together**.


### 3. **Annotation Insights**

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbyan/deeva/main/assets/annotations.gif">

- **Bounding Box Analysis**: Provides insights into box center, width/height, and median box sizes.
- **Box Size Distribution**: Analyzes box size categories with **adjustable thresholds** for small, medium, and large sizes.


### 4. **Image Statistics**

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbyan/deeva/main/assets/images.gif">

- **Color Analysis**: Displays **dominant colors** and their tones extracted from images.
- **Image Dimensions**: Examines **height, width,** and aspect ratios across your dataset.
- **CBS (Contrast, Brightness, Saturation)**: Shows **contrast, brightness, and saturation** distributions across the dataset.


### 5. **Overlap Statistics**

<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vbyan/deeva/main/assets/overlaps.gif">

- **Cases**: Classify and **cluster** overlapping instances from two specific classes into `n` predefined cases. Display representative **example images** for each case to help visualize typical overlap patterns.
- **Ratios**: Calculate and visualize the overlap ratio distributions for each class
- **With/without overlaps**: Present a side-by-side comparison of images and co-occurrences with and without overlaps

<br>

## ðŸ”– **Caching & Version control**

Deeva employs efficient **caching** to streamline your data processing workflow. For large datasets, users have the option to **sample a subset of the data**â€”allowing for quicker initial exploration. 

Data extracted during time-consuming operations can be saved as a **dataframe on disk** for effortless access in future sessions, enabling a faster, more efficient experience by skipping redundant processing steps.

To **track different versions** of your dataset you need to simply put them into different folders and **Deeva** will do the rest
